- There may be a bug that causes a character
  to think it's out of SP when it isn't. I think it
  comes up when you do multiple plays in one session,
  but I haven't been able to pin it down.

- When the player is killed by an enemy Rogue's attack
  of opportunity, his status message still prints afterwards
  and he then takes his turn as normal. The turn should stop
  when hte player is killed.

- This may be a general game balance thing, but it is
  nearly impossible for the Wizard to kill the Knight.
